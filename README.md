# Community Meal Planner

A mobile application to support community efforts to sustainably meal plan.

This application is intended to support the following sub-goals of the [UN's 17 Goal for Sustainable Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). These sub-goals are part of [Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/):
1. _12.7_ Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities
1. _12.8_ By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature
1. _12.A_ Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production
1. _12.B_ Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products

The main goal of this application is to introduce sustainability education and community disucssion tools to the convenience tools already on the market (such as recipe databases, recipe calendars, and grocery lists taken from recipes for the week).
