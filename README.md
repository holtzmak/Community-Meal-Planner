# Community of Meal Planners Forums

A forum application to support community discussion for meal planning, sustainable practices, and education.

This application is intended to support the following sub-goals of the [UN's 17 Goal for Sustainable Development](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/). These sub-goals are part of [Goal 12: Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns](https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-consumption-production/):
1. _12.7_ Promote public procurement practices that are sustainable, in accordance with national policies and priorities
1. _12.8_ By 2030, ensure that people everywhere have the relevant information and awareness for sustainable development and lifestyles in harmony with nature
1. _12.A_ Support developing countries to strengthen their scientific and technological capacity to move towards more sustainable patterns of consumption and production
1. _12.B_ Develop and implement tools to monitor sustainable development impacts for sustainable tourism that creates jobs and promotes local culture and products

The meal planning market consists of convenience tools rather than educational tools, limiting what platforms and content members of the community have available. There exists side platforms and content that only those “in the know” access and share. These two situations limit the demand for education and consumption practice change because there is no collective place for members to voice concerns and ask for change.

This project aims to provide members of the meal planning community with a space (forum) for relevant discussion and critique of recipes, practices, and tools that can be received by meal planning companies/tool developers so as to incite community-led change in the status quo.
